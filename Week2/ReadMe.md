For the interactive wall I have an idea of touching the board and it causing water to come out where you touch and then allowing the user to water plants that grow and possibly interact with them. If I have lots of time and figure it out I could have different tools that a person can use to interact with the environment. It could also fill with water and create a river or lake which would be cool. This will be more of an interactive art project rather than a game with a specific goal. I saw a cool interactive wall someone made of an interactive forest for children. Mine would not be this complex but I like the idea behind it. I think this would allow me to push my illustrating and animating in P5Js https://lrbizarrebazaar.wordpress.com/2012/03/27/1679/
